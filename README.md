# Fitness-Android-App

## About this project
FITSAL is a fitness app with various exercises to help users achieve their fitness goals. FITSAL provides users with daily exercises depending on the goal that they set. For example, the app will give the user a set of exercises to do every day for 30 days or 90 days if that is the user’s goal. The app will give users the option to chose whether they working out at home or at the gym and will give them exercises accordingly. 
The app will track the user’s activity and will give them a progress update. The app will send a notification reminder on a specific time of the day that the user has set previously.
